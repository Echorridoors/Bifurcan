# Bifurcan

Named after a Borges short of the same name, similarly to Entaloneralie, this application is a cryptic watchface for iOS. Every second, the labyrinth reorganize itself to display the time with its twists and turns. It takes a little practice to be able to see the patterns in the lines. Clicking on the screen will unveil the time as seen in this video.
